Upload PDF files: Easily upload and store your documents for quick reference.
Ask Questions: Input questions in natural language to get direct answers from the documentâ€™s content.
Real-time Processing: Receive instant, accurate responses based on the text in the PDF.
Seamless Integration: Uses TensorFlow.js and the QnA model to process and extract relevant answers.
Technology Stack:
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Machine Learning: TensorFlow.js (QnA Model)
File Storage: Cloudinary or other cloud storage solutions
PDF Processing: PDF parsing and text extraction for question answering
